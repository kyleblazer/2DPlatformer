Only issue with the game is the jump sound can played a second time while in midair if the spacebar is pressed again. My code is identical to the tutorial as far as I can tell, and it is strange that it can't play any more than twice. I spent some time looking through the code trying to resolve it but I couldn't track down where the issue might be.
